**About**

PoliQuest is a Shadowlands questing addon that automates a significant portion of the leveling experience. It automates quests that require level 50 to 59. The addon is only intended to speed up leveling and should be disabled at level 60.

**Main feature**

The PQButton is a button that appears when you have a Shadowlands quest item in your bags. The addon automatically binds quest items to this button and allows you to effortlessly use quest items by giving you the option to keybind it.

The following macro keybinds the PQButton as well as the arrow button that allows you to cycle through the quest items in your bags. Using the macro while not holding ctrl, alt, or shift will use the quest item, and using the macro while holding alt will cycle through the quest items in your bags.

`/click [nomod]PQButton;[mod:alt]PQNext`

**Commands**

Type "**/pq**" or "**/poliquest**" to open the configuration menu.

Type "**/pq toggle**" or "**/poliquest toggle**" to show/hide the PQButton and reposition it.
